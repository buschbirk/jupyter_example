This project is a part of the [Codeacademy Pro Intensive course on data analysis](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/introduction-to-data-analysis).

It uses Python, SQL and Jupyter Notebooks to explore fictional data from an A/B test
performed by a gym with the purpose of gaining more purchasing customers.
