# Two examples of data analysis using Jupyter Notebooks and Python

Both of these projects are entries in the [Codeacademy Pro Intensive course on data analysis](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/introduction-to-data-analysis).

They are both examples of simple data analysis and visualization using Python Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Project 1: FoodWheel

This project explores customer data from a fictional food delivery startup.
It examines the different types of food offered, order quantities over time and total customer spending.

Examples of content:
* Matplotlib pie-chart with auto-percentage labels
* Matplotlib bar-chart with error bars displaying standard deviation
* Matplotlib histogram

[The analysis](https://github.com/buschbirk/jupyter_example/blob/master/foodwheel/foodwheel.ipynb) (Jupyter Notebook)


## Project 2: MuscleHub

This project uses Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy and SQL to explore fictional data from an A/B test
performed by a gym with the purpose of gaining more purchasing customers.

Examples of content:
* SQL queries using Pandas and SQLite
* Matplotlib pie and bar charts
* Statistical tests using Scipy
* A PDF presentation of the findings
